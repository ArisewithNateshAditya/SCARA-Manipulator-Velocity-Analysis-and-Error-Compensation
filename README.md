Project Name: SCARA Robot: Detailed Kinematic Analysis, Quaternion, DH Parameters, and Workspace Evaluation

Description:
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a SCARA robotic manipulator, focusing on various kinematic and dynamic aspects. It includes calculations of quaternions and rotation matrices, application of Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters, and detailed velocity analysis. The Jacobian matrix is computed to explore degrees of freedom, and the workspace of a three-link planar arm is visualized to illustrate the manipulator's reachability and performance in different configurations.

File Structure:

SCARA_Manipulator_HW2.pdf - The main report containing solutions for each question.
Matlab_Workspace.m - Matlab script used for plotting the workspace of the three-link planar arm.
Jacobians.xlsx - Spreadsheet containing the calculated Jacobian matrices.
Diagrams/ - Folder containing any diagrams or illustrations used in the report.
Readme.md - This file, explaining the contents of the project.
Installation and Usage:
To replicate the workspace calculations, you will need Matlab installed on your system. Run the Matlab_Workspace.m script to generate the workspace plot.
