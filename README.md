Project Name: SCARA Manipulator Velocity Analysis and Error Compensation

Description:
This project focuses on computing joint velocities for a SCARA manipulator using Jacobian matrix relations. It involves error analysis between desired and actual joint values, employing both Jacobian inverse and pseudo-inverse methods for error compensation. MATLAB scripts and plots are provided for detailed analysis.

File Structure:

Project_1_Report.pdf - Detailed report including velocity calculations, error analysis, and MATLAB plots.
Jacobian_Calculations.m - MATLAB script for computing Jacobian matrix and joint velocities.
Error_Analysis.m - MATLAB script for calculating and plotting errors using Jacobian inverse and pseudo-inverse.
Plots/ - Folder containing graphs of errors and joint velocities.
Installation and Usage:
Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system. Open and run the provided scripts (Jacobian_Calculations.m and Error_Analysis.m) to perform velocity analysis and error compensation, and review the generated plots.
